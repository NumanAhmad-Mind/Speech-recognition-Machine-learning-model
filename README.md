This Naive Bayes, Machine learning algorithm was build to recognize the voices of more than 400 individuals from a large dataset. Data set included 15 seconds clips of the voices of each individual. They were speaking different words in each. 

It should be kept in mind that in this modell I did not call any algorithm from Sci-kit learn or other Python libraries. In fact the model was build right from the scratch. And it was implemented using the mathematical knowledge about the content. 

In the picture bellow you can observe that, this model achieve 84% accuracy, which is way more than the standard for a speech recognition model. In the process 25000 iterations were used. Further precision, recall and F1-score are mentioned bellow.
